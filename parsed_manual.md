# Troubleshooting

# Do you hear abnormal sounds from the refrigerator?

Before calling for service, review the checkpoints below. Any service calls related to normal sounds will be charged to the user.

# These sounds are normal.

- When starting or ending an operation, the refrigerator may make sounds similar to a car engine igniting. As the operation stabilizes, the sounds will decrease.
- Clicking! Buzzing! or Chirping!
- While the fan is operating, these sounds may occur. When the refrigerator reaches the set temperature, no fan sound will occur.
- SSSRRR! Whir!
- During a defrost cycle, water may drip on the defrost heater, causing sizzling sounds.
- HiSS!



---


# Troubleshooting

- As the refrigerator cools or freezes, refrigerant gas moves through sealed pipes, causing bubbling sounds.
- Bubbling!
- As the refrigerator temperature increases or decreases, plastic parts contract and expand, creating knocking noises. These noises occur during the defrosting cycle or when electronic parts are working.
- Cracking!
- For ice maker models: When the water valve opens to fill the ice maker, buzzing sounds may occur.
- Because of pressure equalizing when opening and closing the refrigerator door, whooshing sounds may occur.

| Could not find “SmartThings” in the app market.                                    | • The supporting software version of the SmartThings app is subject to change according to the OS supporting policy the manufacturer provides. In addition, as for the SmartThings app or the functions that the app supports, the new application update policy on the existing OS version can be suspended due to usability or security reasons. • The SmartThings app is available for applicable models only. |
| The SmartThings app fails to operate.                                              | • The old Samsung Smart Refrigerator app cannot connect with Samsung Smart Home models. • You must log into your Samsung account to use the app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| The SmartThings app is installed but is not connected to my refrigerator.          | • Make sure that your router is operating normally. • If the Wi-Fi icon on the refrigerator’s display is off, this indicates that no network connection has been established yet. In this case, use the SmartThings app to connect and register your refrigerator to the access point (AP) of your house.                                                                                                         |

| An error message appears when I try to register my refrigerator.                   | • Easy Connection may fail due to the distance from your access point (AP) or electrical interference from the surrounding environment. Wait a moment and try again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The SmartThings app is successfully connected to my refrigerator but does not run. | • Exit and restart the SmartThings app, or disconnect and reconnect the router. • Power off the refrigerator, and then power it on again after 1 minute. • Connect your refrigerator with the SmartThings app before use. When the connection is made successfully, the indicator stops blinking.                                                                                                                 |
